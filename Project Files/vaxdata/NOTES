Notes for user manual:

For vaccination:

Please install sodapy (Socrata) to get information from CDC's API. This is for the Vaccination module.
You can use the following command:

pip install sodapy




No Texan county provides vaccination information through the CDC system.
So vaccination info for Texas was retrieved directly from TX State Department of Health.
Texas Department of Health publishes vaccination information at county level only as Excel file
So it had to be processed and then merged with the CDC's information.
