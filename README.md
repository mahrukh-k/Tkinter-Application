Team: Ricardo Ibarra-Gil, Joseph Bajor, Mahrukh Khan

Through this project we aimed to create a Python application that can help people moving to a new location in U.S. The application takes user input (State and County) and provides indicators on living conditions including health, rent, vaccination and crime.
